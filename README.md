we are are interacting with the code, and it will ask you to state your name

Peer Reviewed: Arely -- The program does its job of using my input and displaying my name at the end of the code. Like most people's program ive reviwed Manuel's also had a different appraoch on the data vaildation for if the player wants to play again. Its actaully unique from what ive seen.
So I praise him for that.
